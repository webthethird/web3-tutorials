# web3-tutorials
A place for me to work through Web3 tutorials in public. 

### Credit where credit is due
I am starting with the [free, Full-stack Web3 course](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js) 
from [freeCodeCamp.org](freecodecamp.org) by the wonderful [Patrick Collins](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC).
I know I have been putting this off for far too long, but now I certainly don't have any excuse for continuing to do so!
