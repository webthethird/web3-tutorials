# web3-tutorials

---

A place for me to work through Web3 tutorials in public.

### Credit where credit is due

---

I'm starting with the [free, Full-stack Web3 course](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js)
from [freeCodeCamp.org](freecodecamp.org) by the wonderful [Patrick Collins](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC).
I know I have been putting this off for far too long, but now I certainly don't have any excuse for continuing to do so!

## Notes

---

In addition to taking notes as comments in the code itself, I'll take some broader notes here as I go along.

- _Dear future employers:_ Let it be known that, while I'm starting from the beginning of the course, I have been able
  to write (unsophisticated) Solidity contracts for years. Sure, some content in the first handful of lessons seems
  trivial after two years of graduate-level education in computer science and even longer in-and-out-and-back into Web3.
  But the way I see it, Patrick put this course together as a masterclass on Web3, so of course there are going to be
  insightful nuggets of useful info nestled in there with the introductory stuff. Anyway, what better place is there to
  start than from the top? All I know is I need to put what I know together with everything else I need to learn to finish
  what I started years ago, and I need to start _right now!_

- Chainlink out-of-the-box features:
  - Price Feeds
  - Verifiable Random Numbers (VRF)
  - Keepers: Listen for external triggers and look-up actions specified for specific contracts
  - Http GET API calls (does not come with the decentralized network of Chainlink nodes)
- Requesting data from Chainlink nodes requires LINK
